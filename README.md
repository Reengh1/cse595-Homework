# Introduction:
This project is primarily divided into four parts: *Task1*, *Task2*,*Task3*, and *Task4*.
- *Task1*:  Primarily includes two functions: tokenize and better_tokenize, corresponding to problems 1 and 2.
- *Task2*:  It primarily accomplishes two tasks: constructing a vocabulary list and converting the training .csv file into a sparse matrix. Corresponding to problem 3.
- *Task3*:  Primarily a NumPy implementation of logistic regression. Corresponding to problems 4 through 10.
- *Task4*: Primarily a PyTorch implementation of logistic regression, corresponding to problems 11 through 18.
# How to run?
First, you need to create a vocabulary list and a sparse matrix. Therefore, you should run task2 first. The address section in task2 has been commented out; you should replace it with the address on your own computer.


After that, you can proceed to train the model. Task3 is a NumPy implementation of logistic regression, while Task4 is a PyTorch implementation of logistic regression. Both are independent of each other.
